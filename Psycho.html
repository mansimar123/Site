<h1>Psycho</h1>
</header>
<main>
<section class="movie">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hold onto your shower curtains, folks, because we've got a review that'll chill you to the bone. Shower? What am I even blabbering about? Well, “Psycho” is the classic thriller that made viewers never want to take a shower again. And let me tell you, after watching this film, I'm considering switching to exclusively taking baths. Today, we're taking a dive into the iconic thriller classic that had America double-locked their doors in 1960. So, did it live up to the hype after 61 years? Let's get into it.</p>
</section>
<section class="movie">
<h1>Plot</h1>
<p>In search of love and a brand new start, <br>
    Marion Crane takes off with a heavy heart. <br>

<p> Run by Norman with his mother always nigh, <br>

The motel's secrets begin to come alive. <br>

As Marion fights to hide what she's taken, <br>

<p> Beneath the surface of this misty town, <br>

Lies madness and a killer that won't back down. <br>

This timeless classic will make your skin crawl, <br>

As you witness the twisted tale of Psycho's drawl.</p>

<section class="movie">
  <h1>All the good elements</h1>
  <p>First things first, you can't talk about "Psycho" without mentioning the mastermind behind it all: Alfred Hitchcock. The "Master of Suspense" proves once again that he reigns supreme with a film that still holds up today. From the first frame to the last, Hitchcock's direction is impeccable, with every shot serving a purpose, every edit ratcheting up the tension. Sure, some of the effects look dated now, but that doesn't diminish the technical brilliance at play.

    Of course, none of this would matter if the cast couldn't sell it. Luckily, they do. Janet Leigh puts in a career-defining performance as Marion Crane, the woman whose theft leads her down a path of madness, while Anthony Perkins is downright mesmerizing as Norman Bates. His portrayal of the creepily charming motel owner is so iconic, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. These two leads carry the film effortlessly, and their chemistry makes their scenes together all the more electric.
    
    Talking about standout performances, let's not forget to mention Martin Balsam as Detective Arbogast. His limited screen time is some of the most memorable, and his character's fate is one of the film's more shocking moments. Speaking of shocks, we can't forget about the infamous shower scene. Even if you've never seen the film, you're familiar with it, and it's just as brutal and unforgettable as you've heard.</p>

  <h1>All the Negatives</h1>
  <p>In terms of flaws, there's not much to nitpick about here, given that the film has stood the test of time. Potential viewers should be warned that the legendary twist might be predictable nowadays, thanks to cultural osmosis, but that doesn't make it any less impactful when it comes. You're still on the edge of your seat, waiting for everything to fall apart.
    One of the things that set "Psycho" apart from other horror films at the time, besides its twist, was Bernard Herrmann's score. The main theme has since become iconic, even outside its relationship to the film. It's was a bold move to have so much of the action take place in silence, but it's a choice that pays off incredibly well.</p>
</section>
<section class="movie">
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>But don't let those critiques fool you. "Psycho" is a seminal piece of cinema history that still shocks and scares to this day. Hitchcock's direction combined with impeccable performances make this a film that everyone needs to see at least once (it's a right of passage, in a way). Just be sure to lock your doors and check your shower curtain first.</p>
